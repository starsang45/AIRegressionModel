#Title
Building a Simple Regression Model with Amazon SageMaker

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning regression model using Amazon SageMaker. This model will predict employeesâ€™ salaries based on their years of experience. The goal is to enable HR departments to make data-driven salary predictions for new hires using historical data.

Methodology
Data Collection

The dataset contains two columns:
Input: Years of experience.
Output: Corresponding employee salaries.
The data is collected by the HR department and is used to understand the relationship between experience and salary.
Linear Regression Model

A simple mathematical equation will be used to map the relationship between years of experience and salaries.
The goal is to minimize the error and find a line that best fits the data points.
Training the Model

Train the regression model using the input dataset to derive the equation that predicts salaries accurately.
Model Deployment

Deploy the trained model to Amazon SageMaker to make real-time predictions for new employees based on their years of experience.
Prediction Example

For a new hire with 3 years of experience, the model predicts an approximate salary of $40,000 based on historical data.
Future Steps

Once the basics are mastered, expand to more complex datasets and realistic scenarios, leveraging advanced features of Amazon SageMaker.
